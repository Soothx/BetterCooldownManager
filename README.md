* Open Advanced Settings.
* Icon Zoom control.
* Global Font Settings (Font, Size, Flags, Shadows).

* Primary & Secondary Power Colour customization.

## Additional Modules

* Player Cast Bar

## Cooldown Viewers

All Viewers share the same settings, meaning you have full control on what you want your Cooldown Viewers to look like.

### Anchoring

* Utility, Buffs, and Defensive Viewers can anchor to a broad selection of frames.
* Add custom anchors manually or pick from predefined frames with the **Parent Selector**.

### Positioning & Layout
