## Libraries
- [Ace3](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ace3): Database & Configuration Windows are all handled by Ace3 & Ace3 GUI.
- [LibDeflate](https://github.com/SafeteeWoW/LibDeflate.git): Handles importing/exporting of profiles.

## About the Project
This is a passion project & this has to be maintained as much as possible in order for the longevity of the AddOn. It is solo-developed, but some very kind people from the community have already started contributing.

[Pull Requests](https://github.com/DaleHuntGB/BetterCooldownManager/pulls) are welcome, but I ask that you maintain the structure & layout of my code. Additionally, not all Pull Requests made will be accepted. Anything added is another thing to maintain.

If you find [Issues](https://github.com/DaleHuntGB/BetterCooldownManager/issues), please raise them appropriately and provide as much context as possible. If you have error codes, they help tremendously.

## Future Plans
In the future, skinning the Buff Bars will be available. The code & GUI are all present already but final improvements are still to be made. Along with this, Custom Glows will be added when I find time to implement them appropriately.
